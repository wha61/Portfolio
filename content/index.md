Hello! I’m Bruce. 4th year [Computing Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/current-students/undergraduate-students/programs/computing-science-major.html) student @ Simon Fraser University. I’m interested in Full Stack Software Development, Mobile App Development, Machine Mearning, and Computer Vision.

I'm currently working as a Full Stack Software Developer at Shandong Leading Petro-Tech, Sinopec, and I am also learning and trying to get the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/).

This website is my digital space where I'll share my experiences, projects, and thoughts through blogs. It's still under construction, but I plan to keep it updated regularly.

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, traveling, and assembling Gundam models.

Stay tuned for updates and thanks for stopping by!
