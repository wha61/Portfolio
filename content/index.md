I am a Full Stack Software Developer with expertise in frontend, backend, and database management, as well as mobile app development and software testing. My strong interest and proficiency extend to Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Robotics Systems.

Previously, I worked as a Full Stack Software Developer at Shandong Leading Petro-Tech, Sinopec. This summer, I completed a software engineering role developing the [iCradle Health Care System](https://github.com/drbfraser/CRADLE-Platform), a health care delivery support system for pregnant women, under the guidance of [Dr. Brian Fraser](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/people/faculty/brianfraser.html). Additionally, I was part of the [Prestrack-DSTI](https://www.dsti.gov.sl/prestrack/) testing team for a new [software release](https://www.dsti.gov.sl/prestrack/).

Currently, I am a research assistant at the [SFU Mars Lab](https://robotics.sfu.ca/mars.html) and have started my role as a Teaching Assistant at Simon Fraser University, working alongside [Dr. Brian Fraser](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/people/faculty/brianfraser.html) in [Python Programming course](https://opencoursehub.cs.sfu.ca/bfraser/grav-cms/cmpt120/home).

I am also pursuing the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/).

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, where I serve as a Teaching Assistant at [Stage 18 Badminton Centre](https://www.stage18badminton.com/), traveling, and eating delicious food.


This is my digital space where I share my experiences, projects, thoughts, and so on. It's still under construction, but I plan to keep it updated regularly. Stay tuned for updates and thanks for stopping by!
